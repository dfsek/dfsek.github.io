        <p>
            The Right to Repair is a fundamental right of consumers. Inherent in
            ownership of something is the ability to take it apart, and to fix it.
            Why are we letting corporations like Apple take that away?
        </p>
        <h2>Ownership</h2>
        <p>
            Right to Repair is, at its core, a movement about ownership. When you
            buy something, do you really own it? Most consumers would say yes, but
            upon closer inspection, many of our electronic devices are only partially
            owned by us. Any smart home gadget requires connections to servers run by
            the company that made it to function; if the company blocks your smart
            home device from connecting, or takes down their servers, the device is
            reduced to a paperweight.
        </p>

            <figcaption style="font-size: 14px">Google could disable your Google
                Home's ability to access Google servers at any moment, making it
                effectively a paperweight.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Many manufacturers will block devices from
            accessing their servers when modifications are detected. Tesla, the
            famous electric car company, is notorious for blocking modified Teslas
            from using their Supercharger charging stations. When the manufacturer
            controls how you use your hardware, and whether you can disassemble,
            upgrade, or repair it, do you really own it?
        </p>
        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
            Another way companies try to seize ownership of purchased hardware is
            by refusing to sell parts to repair it. Apple is known to deny parts
            to third-party repair technicians, instead requiring people to bring
            their device to an Apple store, where they are free to ridiculously
            overcharge for simple repairs.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="./overcharge.png" alt="Apple certified repair technician overcharging for laptop repair"/>
            <figcaption style="font-size: 14px">Apple is notorious for overcharging for replacement parts.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Apple also ensures, through contracts
            with manufacturers, that parts can never get into the hands of consumers.
            If you are unable to source the parts needed to repair something you
            bought, do you really own the device, or are you merely "renting" it
            from the manufacturer, until it needs to be serviced?
        </p>
        <h2>"If <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup">
            Louis</a> had his way, everything would be made of big, clunky plastic!"</h2>
        <p>
            Many misinterpret the goals of right to repair, believing that "if
            right to repair advocates had their way, everything would be made of
            big, clunky plastic with massive Phillips-head screws." Right to repair
            is not about making things <i>easy</i> to repair, it is about making them <i>able</i>
            to be repaired. Repair technicians will gladly use exotic or small screws,
            get through glued parts, and use pry tools to open devices, so long as
            they are allowed to by the manufacturer, and are provided access to the
            tools and parts needed to do so.

            <figcaption style="font-size: 14px">iPhones are very difficult for consumers or
                third parties to service, since Apple does not sell replacement parts.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Right to repair requires no change to
            the design of devices, it simply requires changes to the policies
            manufacturers must abide by.
        </p>
        <h2>Supporting Right to Repair</h2>
        <p>
            The best way to support right to repair is by supporting grassroots
            movements lobbying for it, such as Louis Rossmann's
            <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/lets-get-right-to-repair-passed">Repair Preservation
                Group Action Fund</a>. The Repair Preservation Group Action Fund creates
            petitions to show politicians that citizens support right to repair.
            Currently, they aim to raise $6,000,000 to get a direct-ballot
            initiative sent to voters to get Right to Repair legislation passed.
            Most voters support right to repair, since it directly benefits
            consumers, however getting right to repair legislation is difficult
            due to lobbying against it from corporations. Right to repair is a
            very important issue, since enforcement of it gives consumers more
            ownership of their devices. Getting right to repair legislation passed
            would benefit all consumers, since it would make devices usable longer
            and give the user more control.
